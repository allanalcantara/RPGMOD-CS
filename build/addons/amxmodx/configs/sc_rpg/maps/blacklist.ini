;	Here you can blacklist certain maps, whole map series, or every single map by using a wildcard.
;		Examples:
;			*	// This will affect every map, which means it will read the other ini files on the root folder.
;			escape_series // This will take effect on the whole escape_series maps, or every map that contains escape_series.
;			bm_sts		//	This will only take effect on the map bm_sts
;
;	When a map, or its series has been written down, it will then read the map folder for the ini files.
;		Examples:
;			configs/sc_rpg/maps/toonrun/
;			configs/sc_rpg/maps/escape_series/
;			configs/sc_rpg/maps/bm_sts/

;	<map>
